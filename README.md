# TurtleMaze


This Python program generates a random maze using the turtle graphics library.
It uses a modified Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to "carve" a path through a grid of cells.

Each cell of the grid represents a square that can be visited or revisited depending on how the algorithm decides to move, giving the maze its natural, random feel.

You can optionally enable “strange” mode for more unpredictable paths or solve mode to draw the solution path from start to finish.
